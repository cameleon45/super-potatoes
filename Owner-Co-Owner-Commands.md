These commands are not available for normal use. They are used for debugging and also on special occasions.

|Commands|Usage|
|--------|-----|
|`reboot`| Kashima will commence reboot.|
|`eval` *statement* | some dangerous stuff that I can't let you touch, but for a good reason, because this command exposes the internals of Kashima.|
|`say` *message* | lets Kashima say something I told her.|
